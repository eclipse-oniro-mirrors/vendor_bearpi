### Development board overview

BearPi[（BearPi-HM Nano）](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=633296694816)is a development board specially built by BearPi school for openharmony system. It carries a highly integrated 2.4GHz WLAN SOC chip hi3861, and carries NFC circuit and standard E53 interface. The standard E53 interface can expand cases such as intelligent humidifier, intelligent desk lamp, intelligent security, intelligent smoke detector, etc

### Development board function
BearPi-HM Nano development board, for developers, is used for openharmony development and learning. At the same time, it provides rich cases and tutorials to realize full scene application design

1. E53 interface: it is a standard interface with rich resources and easy to expand. It realizes multi application case expansion, making case development more flexible and convenient

2. NFC: the on-board NFC RF circuit, combined with the key capabilities of openharmony, can perfectly realize the "touch and touch" networking mechanism and service pull-up function of openharmony system, reduce the complexity of user operation, and improve the user experience

3. User keys: open function keys. The key functions are fully defined by the developer, which increases user operability
